# BASIC Subfolder

## Overview
The `BASIC` subfolder is specifically tailored for training the AI in the VizDoom BASIC environment (https://vizdoom.farama.org/). This environment simulates the classic game of Doom, providing a complex and dynamic setting for the AI to learn and adapt.

## Contents
- **current_models.py:** This script is used to train the AI using selected reinforcement learning algorithms in the BASIC Doom environment.
- **PPO_settings.txt:** Contains configuration settings for the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, tailored for the BASIC environment.

## Expanding the BASIC Environment
To expand the training capabilities or add new features to the BASIC environment:
1. Update or create new scripts for training.
2. If incorporating a new algorithm, make sure to add it to the `Algorithms` subfolder.
3. Adjust or add configuration files as needed.
4. Update this README to reflect any new additions or changes.

## Contribution
We welcome contributions to enhance the training process in the BASIC environment. Please follow the main project's guidelines for contributing.
