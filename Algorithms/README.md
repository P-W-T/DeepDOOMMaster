# Algorithms Subfolder

## Overview
This subfolder within the AI Doom Player project is dedicated to housing the various reinforcement learning algorithms used to train the AI agent. 

## Current Algorithms
- **PPO.py:** Implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. This file contains the necessary code to train the AI agent using the PPO algorithm, known for its efficiency and effectiveness in complex environments.

## Adding New Algorithms
As the project evolves, more algorithms will be added to this subfolder. The process for adding new algorithms is as follows:
1. Develop the algorithm in a separate Python file.
2. Ensure the file is well-documented and tested.
3. Add the file to this subfolder.
4. Update this README to include a brief description of the new algorithm.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance or expand the algorithms in this subfolder are welcome. Please adhere to the main project's contribution guidelines.
